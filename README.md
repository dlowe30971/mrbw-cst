Wireless Control Stand Throttle (ProtoThrottle)

This is an attempt to use the ISE PT for a different application. It is not intended to commercial but a 
personnel realistic hand throttle for a steam locomotive. 

My throttle stand will utilise the ISE component structure and connection infrastructure.

I have forked the code so changes that I make will not affect ISE.

Thanks again to Michael and Nathan and the rest of the team at ISE for this wonderful innovation to the hobby and allowing me to 
explore this idea.

This code is high experimental and I cannot guarantee that it will work.
